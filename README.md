# Receipt Themed Portfolio
A creative developer portfolio that looks like a receipt — simple, printable, and cleverly styled to showcase skills, experience, and projects.

A developer portfolio disguised as a receipt.
Minimalist, clever, and straight to the point — this site reimagines the traditional CV by presenting it as a store receipt. From experience and skills to projects and social links, everything is itemized like a purchase list. Designed to be memorable, printable, and refreshingly different, this portfolio proves that great design doesn’t need bells and whistles — just a little creativity.
